        Run Debian in your Local Area Network
       =======================================

The goal of the "Debian Local Area Network"-project is to make setting
up Debian in a local area network as easy as possible.  This repository
offers ansible playbooks and instructions for the following machines:

 • installbox:  orchestration of automatic installs in the LAN
     - set up as gateway to some external network (WAN)
     - provides TFTP installations on the LAN interface
     - automatic installs: preseeding and ansible playbooks
     - package cache

 • kerberox:  serving a minimalistic kerberized LAN
     - automatic TFTP installation of clients
     - centralized home directories on kerberized NFS
     - simple script to manage users and machines

 • kerberox-client:  the client for the kerberized LAN

 • kiosk:  school's computer, hackerspace, …
     - auto login user
     - reasonable defaults
     - temporary home directory on tmpfs, reset at boot

 • cloudbox:  nextcloud server in the basement
     - setup of a home cloud server
     - dynamic DNS name
     - …

Contributions like patches, suggestions, pull requests and/or further
profiles are highly appreciated!

 Instructions
==============

Installbox
~~~~~~~~~~
 • standard Debian installation:
   - user 'ansible' in sudo group
   - WAN interface configured and connected
   - LAN interface not configured/managed

 • optional:  customize installbox.yml

 • run ansible:
     ssh-copy-id ansible@1.2.3.4
     ansible-playbook installbox.yml -v --become --ask-become-pass -u ansible -i 1.2.3.4,

 • the installbox can be used to install all other profiles

Kerberox
~~~~~~~~
 • standard Debian installation:
   - user 'ansible' in sudo group
   - WAN interface configured and connected
   - LAN interface not configured/managed

 • optional:  customize kerberox.yml

 • run ansible:
     ssh-copy-id ansible@1.2.3.4
     ansible-playbook kerberox.yml -v --become --ask-become-pass -u ansible -i 1.2.3.4,

Kerberox and installbox provide a local ansible configuration space
which can be used to install clients and/or to check/modify the local
installation.  To do the latter, cd into 'debian-lan' and run:

   'ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass -v  -i localhost, -c local  kerberox.yml'

The kerberox-clients are automatically installed using the included TFTP netboot
installer within the LAN.

Kiosk
~~~~~
 • Debian installation:
   - user 'ansible' in sudo group

 • customize kiosk.yml:
   - WiFi parameters
   - package selection: extra_pkgs and extra_pkgs_bpo for backports
   - desktop environment

 • run ansible:
     ssh-copy-id ansible@1.2.3.4
     ansible-playbook kiosk.yml -v --become --ask-become-pass -u ansible -i 1.2.3.4,

        Run Debian in your Local Area Network
       =======================================

The goal of the "Debian Local Area Network"-project is to make setting
up Debian in a local area network as easy as possible.  This repository
offers ansible playbooks and instructions for the following machines:

 • Installbox:
     - set up as gateway to some external network (WAN)
     - providing TFTP installation on the LAN interface
     - automatic installs: preseeding and ansible playbooks
     - squid package cache
     use case: orchestration of automatic installs in the LAN

 • Kiosk:
     - auto login user
     - reasonable defaults
     - temporary home directory on tmpfs, reset at boot
     use case: school's computer, hackerspace, …

 • Cloudbox:
     - setup of a home cloud server
     - dynamic DNS name
     - …
     use case: nextcloud server in the basement

Contributions like patches, suggestions, pull requests and/or further
profiles are highly appreciated!
